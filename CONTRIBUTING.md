### Why you should read this guideline.

# How to report a bug
### Verify if the bug is a security issue !
If you find a bug on the solution and you think or knwow it's a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue please. Email "issiakhem.mohamedramzi@gmail.com" instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
 * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
 * Can I disable something for other people?

 If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at "issiakhem.mohamedramzi@gmail.com".

### How to file a bug report.
After checking that the bug is not a matter of security, you can use this template below to let us understand better the environement that you used to find the bug.
